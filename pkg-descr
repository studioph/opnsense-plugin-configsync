Configuration Sync (configsync) is an OPNsense plugin designed to one-way synchronize the OPNsense system configuration .xml files to an (S3 compatible) cloud-storage provider.

Support for the following cloud storage providers:
 * Amazon - S3
 * Google - Cloud Storage
 * Digital Ocean - Spaces
 * Other - S3 compatible endpoints

Configuration Sync works well on OPNsense systems with MultiCLOUDsense in conjunction with DevOps tools like Terraform or Ansible to achieve instance automation to create, destroy and re-create OPNsense instances.

Configuration Sync also happens to be a great OPNsense configuration backup solution when used by itself.
