Configuration Sync (configsync) is an OPNsense plugin designed to one-way synchronize the OPNsense system configuration .xml files to an (S3 compatible) cloud-storage provider.  Actions for configsync are triggered by an OPNsense syshook-config event.

Support for the following cloud storage providers:
 * Amazon Web Services - S3
 * Google - Cloud Storage
 * Digital Ocean - Spaces
 * Other - S3 compatible endpoints

Configuration Sync is well-suited to DevOps automation arrangements where OPNsense instances need to be re-invoked with a previously existing configuration.

Configuration Sync happens to be a great OPNsense configuration backup solution when used by itself.
